# POC_Unsupervised_AI

Title: Developed an Unsupervised AI model for Clustering 
Tools Used: Machine learning, Unsupervised AI, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Sick itlearn, K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN Clustering, HIERARCHICAL Clustering, Principal Component 
Description:
Data Preparation: Performed data extraction and cleaning, focusing on selecting and engineering relevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and insights in the dataset.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and enhance clustering performance.
Clustering Techniques: Implemented K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to segment the data into distinct groups.
Model Evaluation: Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores to evaluate and refine the clustering models for optimal results.
Outcome: Successfully identified distinct clusters, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and showcasing the practical application of advanced clustering techniques.
