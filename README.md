# POC_Unsupervised_AI

Title: Developed an Unsupervised AI model for Clustering 
Tools Used: Machine learning, Unsupervised AI, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Sick itlearn, K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN Clustering, HIERARCHICAL Clustering, Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA), Statistics.
Description: 
 Performed data extraction and cleaning, focusing on relevant features. 
 Conducted EDA with Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns. Applied PCA for dimensionality 
reduction, then used K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering for segmentation. 
 Evaluated clusters with the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores, refining models for optimal 
results. 
 Identified distinct clusters, providing insights for targeted marketing and data-driven strategies, 
demonstrating the practical application of clustering techniques.
